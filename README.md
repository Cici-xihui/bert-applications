Google's Bert algorithm study and real-life applications for Deep Learning project


In this project we will be studying, analyzing and exploring the recently launched Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT). It was launched by Google in Oct 2018 in the following paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805. 

The original repository of Google Research can be found at : https://github.com/google-research/bert

We will also inspire our work and research in the pytorch implementation of BERT made by huggingface : https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT/

In a first moment we have devoted devote all our efforts to better understand how it works and why it is considered a breakthrough in the NLP reasearch field. Some of the material used for this first moment was
